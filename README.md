In this repo I try to implement the things I've learned or find interesting as a reference to remind myself these topics later.

Thinking to put the problem solutions in different sites:   
- Hackerrank (C++(100%) & Problem Solving)
- LeetCode (100+ problems)
- CSES (70+ problems)
- Codeforces (30+ problems)
